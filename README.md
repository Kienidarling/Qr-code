## Overview
To create a QR code component, you'll need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. HTML is used to structure the elements of the component, while CSS is used for styling and positioning.
Here's a general overview of how you can approach this challenge:

1. HTML Structure: Begin by setting up the basic HTML structure of your QR code component. This typically involves creating a container element that will hold the QR code and any additional elements you want to include, such as the h1 or description.
   
2. Styling the QR Code: Use CSS to style the QR code component and make it visually appealing. You can define the size of the QR code, adjust its color scheme, and add any additional styling effects you desire. You may also consider incorporating responsive design techniques to ensure the component adapts well to different screen sizes.

 3. Additional Elements: If you want to add extra elements, such as a label or description, you can include them within the HTML structure. Use CSS to position and style these elements accordingly, making sure they complement the QR code.
